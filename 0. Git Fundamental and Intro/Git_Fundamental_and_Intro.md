# Git Fundamental and Intro

## What is Git and why is it so popular?

Git is the most popular version control system in the world. A version control system records the changes to our code over time in a **special database called repository**. We can look at our project history and see who has made what changes, when, and why. And in case required we can easily revert our project back to an earlier stage. 
In a nutshell through using a version control system we can:

o	Track history and
o	Work together
Version control systems fall into two broad categories:
-	Centralized, the problem with this architecture is single point of failure meaning if the server goes offline we cannot collaborate or save snapshots of our project and so we have to wait until the server comes back online 
-	Distributed, in this system we donâ€™t have the problem mentioned above with Centralized system, every team member has a copy of the project locally on their machine and if the central server goes offline we can synchronize our work directly with others. Git and Mercurial are examples of distributed version control systems 
Git is the most popular version control system in the world, it is almost everywhere: more than %90 of the software projects in the world use Git and so that is why in almost every software engineering job posting you see Git as a skill required, because Git is 
-	Free
-	Open source
-	Super fast
-	Scalable
-	Cheap branching/merging
