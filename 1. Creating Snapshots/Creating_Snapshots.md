# Creating Snapshots

## Introduction

The first thing to know to be able to use Git effectively is **creating snapshots** of your project. 

**Initializing a Repository

Follow these steps to initialize your git repo:

o	Creating a directory for your project, which could be anywhere on your machine. 

o	I can create a git repository using **git init**

o	To open a .git: in the Git Bash terminal I need to type explorer .git and press enter, the files/folders that I find there in my git directory or repository are **config, HEAD, hooks, info, etc.** this is where Git stores information about my project’s history, I do NOT need to understand these details and structures because these are purely implementation details. It is how Git stores information it is none of our business:) That is why this .git directory is hidden so that we don’t touch it. If we corrupt or remove this directory we will lose our project’s history. 

o	In windows I can install posh-git to make thing pretty, it is completely optional.
