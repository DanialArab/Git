# Creating Snapshots

## Introduction

The first thing to know to be able to use Git effectively is **creating snapshots** of your project. 

## Initializing a Git Repository

Some points on how to initialize a git repo:

+ First we create a directory for our project, which could be anywhere on our machine. 

+ I can create a git repository using **git init**

+ To open a .git: in the Git Bash terminal I need to type explorer .git and press enter, the files/folders that I find there in my git directory or repository are **config, HEAD, hooks, info, etc.** this is where Git stores information about my project’s history, I do NOT need to understand these details and structures because these are purely implementation details. It is how Git stores information it is none of our business:) That is why this .git directory is hidden so that we don’t touch it. If we corrupt or remove this directory we will lose our project’s history. 

+ In windows I can install posh-git to make thing pretty, it is completely optional.

## Git Workflow

We have a project directory in which we have a hidden subdirectory i.e., our .git repository. As part of our every day tasks we modify more and more files in our project directory, when our project reaches a state that we want to record we commit those changes into our repository. Creating a commit is like taking a snapshot of our project. In Git we have a special area called **staging area or index**, which does not exist in most other version control systems, we essentially propose what we want for the next commit or snapshot. 

When we are done making changes in our file in project directory we add them into the staging area for review and if everything is good then we make a commit then the snapshot will be permanently stored in our repository. So **staging area allows us to review our work before recording a snapshot.** If some of the changes should not be recorded as part of the next snapshot we can **un-stage them and commit them as part of another snapshot.**

Some points:

+ We use add command to add the files to the staging area like git add file1 file2 
+ We use the commit command to permanently store the snapshots in our repository like git commit –m “initial commit” as part of this we supply a meaningful message, initial commit in this example, to indicate what this snapshot represents this is essential for having a useful history (tips: 1- the dash m in the commit command is for message 2- if we have space in the message we need to have a double quote)
+ As we fix bugs, implement new features, and refactor our code we make commit and each commit clearly explains the state of the project at that point in time 
+	A common misconception about Git is that once we commit the changes the staging area becomes empty, which is not correct. After making a commit we still have the same snapshot as we stored in the repository so this staging area is very similar to the staging environment we use when releasing software to production. 
+ If we no longer need a file like file2 we can delete it from our project directory but this file is still in the staging area so once again we use **add command to stage the change**, which is in this case a deletion like **git add file2** here even though we use add command Git knows that file2 is actually deleted so it will delete this file from the staging area or the next snapshot

**Each commit has:**

+ ID, a unique identifier that is generated by Git it is like a revision number 
+ Each commit also has the following information
  + Message
  + Date/time
  + Author
  + Complete snapshot 

These are info about what was changed by who when as well as a complete snapshot of the project at the time it was created so unlike many other version control systems Git does not store deltas or what was changed, it stores the full content, with this we can quickly restore the project to an earlier snapshot without having to compute the changes 

**Question: is it waste of a lot of space when saving the full content in every snapshot?** NO, b/c Git is very efficient in data storage
+ it compresses the content and 
+	does not store the duplicate contents 

you don’t need to know how Git stores data since it is implementation detail and may even change in the future what you need to know is that **each commit contains a complete snapshot of our project and this allows us to quickly get back to the previous state.**

## Staging Files

Let's write something into two files:

    echo hello > file1.txt 
    echo hello > file2.txt 

git status

    On branch master

    No commits yet

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
            file1.txt
            file2.txt

The two files are in red to indicate they are not in the staging area yet, to add them to the staging area we use **git add** command we can add multiple files separated by **space**, we also can use pattern like git add *.txt to add all the files with txt extension. We can also add the entire directory recursively using git add . but be careful b/c there are times that we don’t want to add large binary files or log files to repository b/c they increase the size of the repository we will learn how to ignore these files later in this section. Just remember git add . add the entire directory recursively. In this demo we go with git add . b/c we only have two small files like
